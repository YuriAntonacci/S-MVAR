# S-MVAR
The Matlab toolbox allows to compute analytically the parameters of a VAR model exploring the different approaches of Sparse regressions. In particular, the methodologies investigated are: Ordinary Least square analysis, LASSO regression, Elastic Net regression, Fused LASSO regression and Sparse Group LASSO regression. Then, as a possible example, the conditional Granger causality (cGC) is computed for multivariate stochastic process elaborating the results provided in [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[5]-[6].

The code is provided free of charge. It is neither exhaustively tested nor particularly well documented. The authors accept no liability for its use. Use, modification and redistribution of the code is allowed in any way users see fit. Authors ask only that authorship is acknowledged and ref. [1]-[4] is cited upon utilization of the code in integral or partial form. To get started, we recommend that you run and work through the two demonstration scripts.
